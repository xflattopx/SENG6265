1. Identify whether the mutant program is killed or alive based on
the test cases provided.

The mutant program is killed based off the test cases because 2000 % 400 will evaluate to false
instead of true.

2) Determine whether the mutant is killed or alive.
Hereâ€™s the solution in both Java and Python.

The mutant program is killed because 25 and 16 are perfect squares thus the mutant is identified basaed
on the test cases.

3) Calculate mutation score for the following:

Total number of mutants: 4
Test Case 1: (3/4) * 100 = 75%
Test Case 2: (1/4) * 100 = 25%
Test Case 3: (3/4) * 100 = 75%
Test Case 4: (1/4) * 100 = 25%
Test Case 5: (2/4) * 100 = 50%
==================================
Average score = 50%
