Input Space Partitions

Valid Triangle Types:
Equilateral: All sides equal (e.g., a = 3, b = 3, c = 3)
Isosceles: Two sides equal (e.g., a = 3, b = 3, c = 5)
Scalene: All sides different (e.g., a = 3, b = 4, c = 5)

Invalid Triangle Conditions:
Not a triangle: The sum of any two sides must be greater than the third (e.g., a + b â‰¤ c)

Test Cases

Valid Triangle Types
Case 1: a = 3, b = 3, c = 3 - Expected: "Equilateral"
Case 2: a = 3, b = 4, c = 5 - Expected: "Scalene"
Case 3: a = 3, b = 3, c = 5 - Expected: "Isosceles"

Invalid Triangle Conditions
Case 4: a = 1, b = 2, c = 3 - Expected: "Not a triangle"
Case 5: a = 0, b = 1, c = 1 - Expected: "Not a triangle"
Case 6: a = 1, b = 1, c = 2 - Expected: "Not a triangle"

Boundary Value Analysis

Valid Boundaries
Equilateral at minimal values: a = 1, b = 1, c = 1 - Expected: "Equilateral"
Isosceles at minimal values: a = 1, b = 1, c = 2 - Expected: "Not a triangle" (just on the edge)
Scalene at minimal values: a = 2, b = 3, c = 4 - Expected: "Scalene"

Invalid Boundaries
Zero side length: a = 0, b = 1, c = 1 - Expected: "Not a triangle"
Negative side lengths: a = -1, b = 2, c = 2 - Expected: "Not a triangle"
